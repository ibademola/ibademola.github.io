        With a profound interest in advancing research frontiers, I have dedicated myself to leveraging machine learning and AI to address urban challenges. Collaborating with esteemed researchers at Queens University, I contributed to a pioneering study aimed at developing a machine learning framework for image segmentation. Our findings were published in the prestigious Journal of Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics. Additionally, I spearheaded the development of an enhanced federated learning framework for near-surface temperature prediction, utilizing land surface temperature and auxiliary data. Currently, a manuscript detailing our advancements is under review in the esteemed Journal of Improved Frontiers. Furthermore, I engineered an ensemble model tailored for city-based air temperature prediction, with our groundbreaking findings presently under review in the Journal of Sustainable Cities and Society.

        Recognizing the profound implications of climate change, I have conducted extensive research endeavors aimed at understanding and mitigating its impacts. Among my notable contributions are studies assessing climate change effects in coastal communities, including Ondo State, and developed regions. These efforts have resulted in publications in top-tier journals, contributing to the global discourse on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.
